## Elements

!!! note "Stub"
	This section is a stub - it may require more detail added to it in future.

### The Fusion logo

Our logo is constructed from two perpendicular intersecting planes, viewed from
an almost-isometric angle. 

This represents how Fusion brings together two different data structures into
one unified whole; Fusion connects the hierachy of instances to the hierachy of state objects.

The logo is designed on an 8x8 pixel grid, making it highly legible and
recognisable at almost any size.

The colours chosen are energetic and warm, giving Fusion a uniquely hot colour
palette compared to the cool blues of most other libraries and frameworks.

Itâ€™s a simple, abstract design, but stands out among many other Roblox libraries
by not depending on the Roblox brand.

of our policy around use of our branding. The rights to the Fusion name, logo
and brand assets remain reserved by Elttob.

We allow the following uses of the Fusion logo and branding by default:

- Representing the (original) Fusion project. 
    - For example, you may use the
the Fusion logo on-screen in a tutorial video when you're referring to the
Fusion project...
    - ...as an image in a news article or blog post where you are talking
about the Fusion project...
    - ...as an icon in a data visualisation to represent the
Fusion project...
    - ...or in general, any use where it's very clear you're referring to the Fusion project.
    This does *not* extend to derived or inspired-by projects.
    
If you wish to use the Fusion logo, name or branding in your project for a use
case which isn't listed above, you must receive explicit written permission

Please do not use the logo or branding in a way that:

- may insinuate support, endorsement or other affiliation with the Fusion
project.
    - It's okay to say you were inspired by Fusion, or are using Fusion as
    part of your project...
    - ...but it's not okay if your project comes off as an official part of
    Fusion, or as something officially endorsed by the Fusion project.
