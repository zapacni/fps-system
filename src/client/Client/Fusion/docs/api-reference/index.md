# API Reference

Fusion is a modern reactive UI library, designed and built for
[Roblox](https://developer.roblox.com/) and [Luau](https://luau-lang.org/).<br>
Here, you can find documentation for every public API exposed by the Fusion module.

## Navigation

Using the sidebar on the left, you can find API members grouped by category.
Alternatively, you can search for APIs using the search box at the top of the
page.

## Type Information

On many API pages, you'll see type annotations describing the API member. For
example:

```Lua
function New(className: string): (props: {[string | Symbol]: any}) -> Instance
```

While these type annotations are designed to be Luau-like, they are ultimately
psuedocode included as a developer aid. For fully accurate and syntactically
valid type information, please refer to the source code directly.
