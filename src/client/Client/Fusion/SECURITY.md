# How To Report A Vulnerability

If you find any security issues or vulnerabilities in Fusion, please get in
contact with Elttob privately - make sure to include details about what the
specific issue is. You should expect to get a response back as soon as possible,
but allow up to 2 days.

If, once the issue is looked into, it is approved, a fix will be worked on and
rolled out with high priority. In most cases, this should be relatively quick,
but unless otherwise specified, allow at least 2 weeks for us to announce a fix
or, failing that, update you on the status of the fix. We make sure to give
attribution to all people who submit approved security issue reports.

If an issue is not approved, then this means it's either 1) been investigated
and determined not to be an issue, or 2) is a duplicate of a report we're
already looking into. In these cases, you will be notified when your issue is
rejected.
